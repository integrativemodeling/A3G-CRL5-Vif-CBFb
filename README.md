# Integrative structure determination of the **A3G-Vif<sub>HIV-1</sub>-CRL5-CBFβ complex.**

## Summary

Integrative structure determination of the A3G-CRL5-Vif-CBFβ complex based on the 132 DSSO cross-links, atomic structures of the components, and previously published mutagenesis data. Preliminary integrative modeling represented the CRL5-Vif-CBFβ complex by a single rigid body defined by atomic structure of the Vif-CBFβ-Cul5N-term-EloB-EloC subcomplex (PDB access code: 4N9F) and comparative models of the full length Cul5 and Rbx2 (<em>rigid representation</em>). Follwing, to characterize the flexibility of the complex, we performed integrative structure modeling of the A3G-CRL5-Vif-CBFβ complex with a modified representation that allowed for relaxation in the configuration of the VCBC subcomplex subunits and for alternative conformations of Cul5 and A3G subunits (<em>flexible representation</em>).The structure was cross-validated based on the data used for modeling and previously published structural, biochemical, and functional data not used for modeling.

## List of files and directories:

- `data` All data used for integrative modeling, including `MODELLER` scripts to generate the comparative models of the components, atomic structures of the components, and crosslinking data.
- `scripts`Topology files for the rigid (`top_A3G_CRL5_3rb.dat` )and flexible (`top_A3G_CRL5_flex.dat`) representations and PMI modeling scripts for the rigid (`mod_A3G_Vif_CRL5_rigid.py`) and flexible (`mod_A3G_Vif_CRL5_flexible.py`) representations.
- `analysis` Scripts to analyze the simulations 
- `results` All the relevent results for the rigid and flexible representations.
- `SI_table` Scripts to generate a table summarizing the integrative modeling protocols.
- `utils` Template and code to generate the <em>Supporting information</em> table summarizing the integrative modeling protocol.
